            <div class="about-me-text">
                <p>Honestly, this is the first project I have done and the first long code I have written.  I am a beginner coder with a strong passion for learning and problem-solving. My journey into coding began with the JKUAT Youth in STEM program I did before I left Kenya, where I am currently learning the fundamentals of programming. With a background as a mathlete in high school, I have always loved numbers and logical reasoning, which naturally led me to explore Computer Science.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-me-text-2">
                <p>My interest in Computer Science stems from my love for challenges and my ability to approach problems analytically. As a former music student, I understand the power of structure and creativity‚Äîtwo essential skills in both music and coding. Whether it's solving a tough algorithm or debugging a stubborn piece of code, I thrive on figuring things out independently before seeking help.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-me-text-3">
                <p>Aspiring to become a Computer Scientist, I am committed to continuously expanding my knowledge and honing my skills. I believe that data holds the key to making informed decisions, and I am excited to be on this journey of learning how to harness its power effectively.</p>

        <h1> My Personal Story:</h1>
        <div class="personal-story-text">
            <p>I did my highschool at Moi High School-Kabarak where I learnt various subjects including the three sciences and Music. In school I was the Band Master and also Choir Leader which molded me into a leader and a team player. I also participated in the Kenya National Music Festival where I won various awards. After highschool, I joined the JKUAT Youth in STEM program where I was introduced to coding and Computer Science. This program ignited my passion for technology and led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science at Gisma University of Applied Sciences.</p>
            <p>My journey has been filled with challenges, but I have always believed in the power of perseverance and hard work. I am excited to continue my studies and explore the endless possibilities that Computer Science has to offer.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing the saxophone, reading books on philosophy and going to the gym. I believe that a well-rounded life is essential for personal growth and creativity, and I strive to maintain a balance between my academic pursuits and personal interests.</p>
