Welcome to my portfolio website project, where I also included a  LaTeX-created CV.
Throughout the project I employed the use of different programming languages; HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
This is one of my first projects and since my knowledge of coding is still quite beginner level I have not created and displayed other projects, but I did try code and integrate a riddle game to entertain the viewer a bit and also show off the much I know.
I hope you enjoy the website, all criticism welcome. 

PS: The Github Pages is opening my link as home.html instead of index.html causing the page not to be displayed sometimes, I've tried to fix it multiple times but I haven't found a permanent one. You can solve this by changing the /home.html to /index.html in the website address and the website will be displayed perfectly. 
Thank you again.
